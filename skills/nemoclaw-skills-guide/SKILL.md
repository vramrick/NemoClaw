# NemoClaw Skills Guide

NVIDIA NemoClaw runs OpenClaw always-on assistants inside hardened OpenShell sandboxes with NVIDIA inference (Nemotron).
It provides CLI tooling, guided onboarding, a security blueprint, routed inference, and workspace management.

This guide lists every agent skill shipped with NemoClaw, organized by audience.
Load the specific skill you need after identifying it here.

## Skill Buckets

Skills are grouped into three buckets by audience.
The prefix in each skill name indicates who it is for.

### `nemoclaw-user-*` (9 skills)

For end users operating a NemoClaw sandbox.
Covers installation, inference configuration, network policy management, monitoring, remote deployment, security configuration, workspace management, and reference material.

### `nemoclaw-maintainer-*` (8 skills)

For project maintainers.
Covers the daily maintainer cadence (morning standup, daytime loop, evening handoff), cutting releases, finding PRs to review, normalizing issue and PR title tags, performing security code reviews, and verifying whether stale bug reports still reproduce on the latest release.

### `nemoclaw-contributor-*` (2 skills)

For contributors to the NemoClaw codebase.
Covers creating pull requests that follow the project template and drafting documentation updates from recent commits.

## Skill Catalog

### User Skills

<!-- user-skills-table:begin -->
| Skill | Summary |
|-------|---------|
| `nemoclaw-user-overview` | What NemoClaw is, ecosystem placement (OpenClaw + OpenShell + NemoClaw), how it works internally, and release notes. |
| `nemoclaw-user-get-started` | Install NemoClaw, launch a sandbox, and run the first agent prompt. |
| `nemoclaw-user-configure-inference` | Choose inference providers during onboarding, switch models without restarting, and set up local inference servers (Ollama, vLLM, TensorRT-LLM, NIM). |
| `nemoclaw-user-manage-policy` | Approve or deny blocked egress requests in the TUI and customize the sandbox network policy (add, remove, or modify allowed endpoints). |
| `nemoclaw-user-monitor-sandbox` | Check sandbox health, read logs, and trace agent behavior to diagnose problems. |
| `nemoclaw-user-deploy-remote` | Deploy NemoClaw to a remote GPU instance, set up the Telegram bridge, and review sandbox container hardening. |
| `nemoclaw-user-configure-security` | Review the risk framework for every configurable security control, understand credential storage, and assess posture trade-offs. |
| `nemoclaw-user-manage-sandboxes` | Manage day-two sandbox operations, including status, logs, diagnostics, rebuilds, upgrades, messaging channels, workspace files, backup, and restore. |
| `nemoclaw-user-reference` | CLI command reference, plugin and blueprint architecture, baseline network policies, and troubleshooting guide. |
<!-- user-skills-table:end -->

### Maintainer Skills

| Skill | Summary |
|-------|---------|
| `nemoclaw-maintainer-morning` | Morning standup: triage the backlog, determine the day's target version, label selected items, surface stragglers, and output the daily plan. |
| `nemoclaw-maintainer-day` | Daytime loop: pick the highest-value version-targeted item and execute the right workflow (merge gate, salvage, security sweep, test gaps, hotspot cooling, or sequencing). Designed for `/loop`. |
| `nemoclaw-maintainer-evening` | End-of-day handoff: check version progress, bump stragglers to the next patch, generate a QA handoff summary, and cut the release tag. |
| `nemoclaw-maintainer-cut-release-tag` | Cut an annotated semver tag on main, move the `latest` floating tag, and push both to origin. |
| `nemoclaw-maintainer-find-review-pr` | Find open PRs labeled security + priority-high, link each to its issue, detect duplicates, and present a review summary. |
| `nemoclaw-maintainer-normalize-title-tags` | Preview and remove bracketed `NemoClaw` title tags from issues and PRs case-insensitively, even when the tag appears later in the title. |
| `nemoclaw-maintainer-security-code-review` | Perform a 9-category security review of a PR or issue, producing per-category PASS/WARNING/FAIL verdicts. |
| `nemoclaw-maintainer-verify-stale` | Verify whether old bug reports still reproduce on latest. Reuses or provisions a Brev box (CPU or GPU), runs the extracted reproducer, scores confidence, and posts an evidence-backed comment with `fixed-on-latest` or `verify-inconclusive`. Tag-only — never auto-closes. |

### Contributor Skills

| Skill | Summary |
|-------|---------|
| `nemoclaw-contributor-create-pr` | Create GitHub pull requests that follow the NemoClaw PR template, including pre-PR checks, conventional commit titles, and DCO sign-off. |
| `nemoclaw-contributor-update-docs` | Scan recent git commits for user-facing changes, draft or update documentation pages, and refresh generated user skills during release prep. |

## Getting Started

Ask the user which role best describes them:

- **User** — operating a NemoClaw sandbox (running, configuring, monitoring).
- **Contributor** — contributing code or docs to the NemoClaw project.
- **Maintainer** — triaging, reviewing, releasing, and managing the project day-to-day.

Skills are cumulative. Each role includes the skills from the roles above it:

| Role | Skills included | Count | Start with |
|------|----------------|-------|------------|
| User | `nemoclaw-user-*` | 9 | `nemoclaw-user-get-started` |
| Contributor | `nemoclaw-user-*` + `nemoclaw-contributor-*` | 11 | `nemoclaw-user-overview` |
| Maintainer | All skills | 19 | `nemoclaw-maintainer-morning` |

After identifying the role, present the applicable skills from the Skill Catalog above and recommend the starting skill.
