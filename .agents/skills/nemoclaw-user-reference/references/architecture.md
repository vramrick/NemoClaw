# Architecture

NemoClaw has two main components: a TypeScript plugin that integrates with the OpenClaw CLI, and a Python blueprint that orchestrates OpenShell resources.

## System Overview

NVIDIA OpenShell is a general-purpose agent runtime. It provides sandbox containers, a credential-storing gateway, inference proxying, and policy enforcement, but has no opinions about what runs inside. NemoClaw is an opinionated reference stack built on OpenShell that handles what goes in the sandbox and makes the setup accessible.

## Deployment Topology

The logical diagram above shows how components relate.
This section shows what actually runs where on the host.
NemoClaw uses a Docker daemon.
The OpenShell gateway runs as a container that embeds a k3s cluster.
The sandbox runs as a Kubernetes pod inside that embedded cluster.

Layering from top to bottom:

| Layer | Runs as | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Host CLI | Host process (`nemoclaw` on Node.js) | Orchestrates OpenShell via `openshell` CLI calls. |
| Docker daemon | Host service | Runs the OpenShell gateway container. |
| Gateway container | Docker container | Hosts the credential store, the L7 proxy, and the embedded k3s control plane. |
| k3s | Process tree inside the gateway container | Kubernetes control plane that schedules the sandbox pod. |
| Sandbox pod | Pod in the embedded k3s cluster | Runs the OpenClaw agent and the NemoClaw plugin under Landlock + seccomp + netns. |
| OpenShell L7 proxy | Process in the gateway container | Intercepts agent egress and rewrites `Authorization` headers (Bearer/Bot) and URL-path segments to inject the real credential at the network boundary. |

NemoClaw never gives the sandbox a raw provider key.
At onboard time it registers credentials with OpenShell's provider/placeholder system, and the L7 proxy substitutes the real value into outbound requests at egress.
The CLI helper `isInferenceRouteReady` (in `src/lib/onboard.ts`) is a host-side readiness check used by the resume flow to decide whether the active route already covers the chosen provider and model — it is not a runtime component.

For the DGX Spark-specific variant of this topology (cgroup v2, aarch64, unified memory), refer to the [NVIDIA Spark playbook](https://build.nvidia.com/spark/nemoclaw).

## NemoClaw Plugin

The plugin is a thin TypeScript package that registers an inference provider and the `/nemoclaw` slash command.
It runs in-process with the OpenClaw gateway inside the sandbox.
It also registers runtime hooks that keep the agent aware of its environment.
Before an agent turn starts, the plugin prepends a short context block with the active sandbox name, sandbox phase, network policy summary, and filesystem policy summary.
When the policy or phase changes during a session, the plugin sends a smaller update block instead of repeating the full context.

## NemoClaw Blueprint

The blueprint is a versioned Python artifact with its own release stream.
The plugin resolves, verifies, and executes the blueprint as a subprocess.
The blueprint drives all interactions with the OpenShell CLI.

```text
nemoclaw-blueprint/
├── blueprint.yaml                  Manifest: version, profiles, compatibility
├── policies/
│   └── openclaw-sandbox.yaml       Default network + filesystem policy
```

The blueprint runtime (TypeScript) lives in the plugin source tree:

```text
nemoclaw/src/blueprint/
├── runner.ts                       CLI runner: plan / apply / status / rollback
├── ssrf.ts                         SSRF endpoint validation (IP + DNS checks)
├── snapshot.ts                     Migration snapshot / restore lifecycle
├── state.ts                        Persistent run state management
```

### Blueprint Lifecycle

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[resolve] --> B[verify digest]
    B --> C[plan]
    C --> D[apply]
    D --> E[status]
```

1. Resolve. The plugin locates the blueprint artifact and checks the version against `min_openshell_version` and `min_openclaw_version` constraints in `blueprint.yaml`.
2. Verify. The plugin checks the artifact digest against the expected value.
3. Plan. The runner determines what OpenShell resources to create or update, such as the gateway, providers, sandbox, inference route, and policy.
4. Apply. The runner executes the plan by calling `openshell` CLI commands.
5. Status. The runner reports current state.

## Sandbox Environment

The sandbox runs the
[`ghcr.io/nvidia/openshell-community/sandboxes/openclaw`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell-Community)
container image. Inside the sandbox:

- OpenClaw runs with the NemoClaw plugin pre-installed.
- Inference calls are routed through OpenShell to the configured provider.
- Network egress is restricted by the baseline policy in `openclaw-sandbox.yaml`.
- Filesystem access is confined to `/sandbox` and `/tmp` for read-write access, with system paths read-only.
- The NemoClaw plugin injects sandbox and policy context into agent turns so the agent can report policy blocks accurately.

## Inference Routing

Inference requests from the agent never leave the sandbox directly.
OpenShell intercepts them and routes to the configured provider:

```text
Agent (sandbox)  ──▶  OpenShell gateway  ──▶  NVIDIA Endpoint (build.nvidia.com)
```

Refer to Inference Options (use the `nemoclaw-user-configure-inference` skill) for provider configuration details.

## Provider Credential Storage

Provider credentials live in the OpenShell gateway store, not on the host filesystem.
NemoClaw never writes them to host disk; the OpenShell L7 proxy injects values at egress.
See Credential Storage (use the `nemoclaw-user-configure-security` skill) for the inspection, rotation, and migration flow.

## Host-Side State and Config

NemoClaw keeps non-secret operator-facing state on the host rather than inside the sandbox.

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `~/.nemoclaw/sandboxes.json` | Registered sandbox metadata, including the default sandbox selection. |
| `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` | Host OpenClaw configuration that NemoClaw snapshots or restores during migration flows. |

The following environment variables configure optional services and local access.

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | Telegram bot token you provide before `nemoclaw onboard`. OpenShell stores it in a provider; the sandbox receives placeholders, not the raw secret. |
| `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_IDS` | Comma-separated Telegram user or chat IDs for allowlists when onboarding applies channel restrictions. |
| `CHAT_UI_URL` | URL for the optional chat UI endpoint. |
| `NEMOCLAW_DISABLE_DEVICE_AUTH` | Build-time-only toggle that disables gateway device pairing when set to `1` before the sandbox image is created. |

For normal setup and reconfiguration, prefer `nemoclaw onboard` over editing these files by hand.
Do not treat `NEMOCLAW_DISABLE_DEVICE_AUTH` as a runtime setting for an already-created sandbox.
